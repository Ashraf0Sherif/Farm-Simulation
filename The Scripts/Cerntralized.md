# **1Ô∏è‚É£ What does this script do?**

This script is responsible for controlling the **growth stages of a plant**. It allows a seed to **grow step-by-step** into a larger plant when it's near a **water can**. Each stage of growth happens after a certain amount of time, and each stage has a unique plant model.

# **3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Concepts (Default Unity Concepts)**

### **1\. MonoBehaviour**

* **What is it?**  
  * It allows the script to be attached to GameObjects.  
  * It provides essential Unity methods like `Start()`, `Update()`, and `OnTriggerEnter()`.

### **2\. GameObject**

* **What is it?**  
  * Every object in Unity is a **GameObject**.  
  * In this script, the **WaterCan** and the **Seed** are GameObjects.  
  * The **plant stages** are also GameObjects (PlantSmall, PlantMedium, etc.).

### **3\. Coroutine**

* **What is it?**  
  * A **Coroutine** is a method that waits before continuing execution.  
  * In this script, it waits for `growthTime` seconds before growing the plant.  
  * This is done using `yield return new WaitForSeconds(growthTime)`.

### **4\. Vector3**

* **What is it?**  
  * **Vector3** represents a position in 3D space (X, Y, Z).  
  * It is used to measure the distance between the plant and the water can.

# **4Ô∏è‚É£ Step-by-Step Instructions (How to Build It in Unity)**

## **üîß Attach the Script**

1. **Add the SeedManager Script**  
   * Create an empty GameObject in the **Hierarchy**.  
   * Rename it **SeedManager**.  
   * Attach the **Cerntralized.cs** script to the **SeedManager**.  
2. **Link the Plant Prefabs to the Script**  
   * Select **SeedManager** in the **Hierarchy**.  
   * Drag the **PlantSmall, PlantMedium, PlantTomatoMedium, PlantTomatoLarge** prefabs into the script slots.

---

# **5Ô∏è‚É£ How the Script Works**

1. When the scene starts, Unity finds all **Seed** objects.  
2. It detects the distance between each **Seed** and the **WaterCan**.  
3. If the water can is close, the seed grows into **PlantSmall**, then into **PlantMedium**, and so on.

# **6Ô∏è‚É£ Key Questions You Might Be Asked**

### **1\. What is MonoBehaviour?**

* It allows scripts to be attached to **GameObjects**.  
* It allows use of methods like **Start()**, **Update()**, and **OnTriggerEnter()**.

### **2\. How do you grow the seed?**

* If the **WaterCan** is close to the seed, a Coroutine is triggered.  
* After **5 seconds**, the seed changes to the next growth stage.

### **3\. How do you add a new growth stage?**

* Add a new **Prefab** for the new growth stage.  
* Add a new entry in the **GrowthStage** enum.  
* Add a new case in the **switch** inside `GrowPlant()`.

### **4\. What would happen if you forget to set the tag of the WaterCan?**

* The script will not be able to find the water can, and the plant will not grow.
