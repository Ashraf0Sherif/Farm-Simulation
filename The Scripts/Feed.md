# **1Ô∏è‚É£ What does this script do?**

This script allows the **sheep** to **grow in size** as it gets closer to a specific type of **feed plant**. As the distance between the sheep and the feed decreases, the sheep gradually grows.

# **3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Concepts (Default Unity Concepts)**

### **1\. MonoBehaviour**

* **What is it?**  
  * It is the **base class** for all scripts in Unity.  
  * It allows the use of methods like `Start()`, `Update()`, and `OnTriggerEnter()`.  
  * Without **MonoBehaviour**, you cannot attach the script to a **GameObject**.

### **2\. GameObject**

* **What is it?**  
  * Everything in the **Hierarchy** is a **GameObject**.  
  * It is a container for **components** like **Transform**, **Rigidbody**, and **Animator**.  
  * In this project, the **Sheep** and **FeedPlant** are GameObjects.

### **3\. Transform**

* **What is it?**  
  * Every GameObject in Unity has a **Transform**.  
  * It controls the **position, rotation, and scale** of the object.  
  * In this script, `transform.localScale` is used to change the sheep's **size**.

### **4\. Vector3**

* **What is it?**  
  * A **Vector3** represents a point or direction in 3D space (X, Y, Z).  
  * `transform.localScale` uses a **Vector3** to change the size of an object.

For example:  
`transform.localScale = new Vector3(1, 1, 1); // Normal size`

### **5\. Animator**

* **What is it?**  
  * The **Animator** controls animations, like running or eating.  
  * In this script, the **Animator** controls the sheep‚Äôs animations as it grows.

# **4Ô∏è‚É£ Step-by-Step Instructions (How to Build This in Unity)**

## **üîß Step 1: Sheep (is prefab from the assets)**

1. **Optional**: Scale the sheep to **(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)** to match the script.  
2. **Attach the ScaleOnProximity script**  
   * Drag the **ScaleOnProximity.cs** file onto the **Sheep** GameObject in the **Hierarchy**.  
   * You'll see it appear in the **Inspector** under **ScaleOnProximity**.

---

## **üîß Step 2: Create the Feed Plant**

1. **Tag the Feed Plant**  
   * Click the **FeedPlant**.  
   * At the top of the **Inspector**, click **Tag** ‚Üí **Add Tag**.  
   * Create a new tag called **feed\_plant**.  
   * Select **FeedPlant** and assign the **feed\_plant** tag.

---

## **üîß Step 3: Connect Components**

1. **Link the Animator**  
   * Select the **Sheep** GameObject.  
   * In the **Inspector**, link the **Animator** field of the **ScaleOnProximity** script to the **Sheep**'s **Animator** component.

---

# **5Ô∏è‚É£ How the Script Works**

1. Every frame, Unity calls `Update()`.  
2. It finds all GameObjects tagged as **feed\_plant**.  
3. It measures the distance from the **Sheep** to each plant.  
   * If the distance is **less than proximityThreshold (5)**, the sheep begins to grow.  
4. The size of the sheep is increased using **transform.localScale**.  
   * The size increase happens gradually, step-by-step, based on **scaleStep (0.1)**.  
5. The sheep stops growing when it reaches its **maximum size (1, 1, 1\)**.

# **6Ô∏è‚É£ Key Questions You Might Be Asked**

### **1\. What does MonoBehaviour do?**

* It allows scripts to be attached to **GameObjects**.  
* It provides access to Unity functions like **Start()**, **Update()**, and **OnTriggerEnter()**.

---

### **2\. How does the script detect when the sheep is near a feed plant?**

* It uses `GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag()` to find all GameObjects tagged as **feed\_plant**.  
* It calculates the distance using `Vector3.Distance()` between the sheep and each plant.  
* If the distance is less than **proximityThreshold**, the sheep starts growing.

---

### **3\. What happens if the sheep grows too big?**

* The script stops growing the sheep once it reaches the maximum size of **(1, 1, 1\)**.

---

### **4\. How can you modify the script so the sheep grows faster?**

* Increase **scaleStep** (this will make the sheep grow faster in each step).  
* Decrease **scaleInterval** (this will make the sheep grow more frequently).

---

### **5\. What happens if the FeedPlant does not have the correct tag?**

* The script won't detect the **FeedPlant**, so the sheep will not grow.  
* **Solution**: Make sure the **FeedPlant** has the tag **feed\_plant**.
